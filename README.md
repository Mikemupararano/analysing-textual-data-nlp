# Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for analysing textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with the help of NLTK and SpaCy libraries. The project covers various aspects of text preprocessing and analysis, providing a comprehensive guide for beginners and practitioners in the field of NLP.

# Installation
Before you start, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.6 or higher.

# Installing NLTK
# Install NLTK via pip:
sh
Copy code
pip install nltk
Download the necessary NLTK datasets:
python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')
nltk.download('words')
Installing SpaCy
Install SpaCy via pip:
sh
Copy code
pip install spacy
Download the SpaCy language model:
sh
Copy code
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Text Preprocessing
Text Normalisation
Text normalisation involves transforming text into a consistent format. This includes converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and handling contractions.

# Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. Both NLTK and SpaCy provide robust tokenization methods.

# Removing Stopwords
Stopwords are common words that usually do not contribute significant meaning to a sentence. Removing stopwords can help in reducing the dimensionality of the data.

# Stemming
Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. NLTK provides several stemming algorithms, such as the Porter Stemmer.

# Lemmatization
Lemmatization is similar to stemming but more sophisticated. It reduces words to their base form while ensuring that the base form is a valid word.

# Text Analysis
POS Tagging
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging involves identifying the grammatical parts of speech in text, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.

# Recognising Entities
Named Entity Recognition (NER) involves identifying entities like names, organizations, locations, dates, etc., in text.

# Dependency Parsing
Dependency parsing involves analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence, establishing relationships between "head" words and words which modify those heads.

# Creating a Word Cloud
A word cloud is a visual representation of word frequency in text data.

# Bag of Words
The Bag of Words (BoW) model represents text data as a collection of words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping multiplicity.

# TF-IDF
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.

# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or emotion conveyed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

# Text Classification
Text classification is the process of assigning predefined categories to text data.

# Text Similarity
Text similarity measures how similar two pieces of text are, which can be useful in various NLP applications.
